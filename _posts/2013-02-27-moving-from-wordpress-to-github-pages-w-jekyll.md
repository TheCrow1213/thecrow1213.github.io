Hello again!

So I've decided to move away from Wordpress.

While blogging with Wordpress is fun and really easy (and has a nice mobile app that I'll miss using), I enjoy having access to the source of the page.

Matt Hinze tells me the new hip blogging tool on the block is [Jekyll] (http://jekyllbootstrap.com), so I had to check it out natrually. While not as easy as Wordpress, I can fool around with the source. Plus this is an opportunity to get more familiar with technologies that I otherwise don't use to often, as well as flex my HTML and CSS muscles once I decide to configure the layout more.
