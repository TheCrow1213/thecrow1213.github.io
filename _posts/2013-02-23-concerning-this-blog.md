In the past week or so I was discussing the Microsoft MVP program with a fellow consultant. He said that at one point he had been nominated for MVP, but apparently didn't blog enough. So I figure that if I wanted to amount to anything as a consultant, that I'd better start blogging.

In all seriousness I've wanted to start a blog for a while, but was unsure as to what information I could provide that might be useful to others. I've decided to start blogging simply because I've been doing a lot of reflecting on my career recently, and for whatever reason feel like putting down on paper.

Everything on here is my opinion of course, and I'm *ALWAYS* looking for feedback. So chime in.
