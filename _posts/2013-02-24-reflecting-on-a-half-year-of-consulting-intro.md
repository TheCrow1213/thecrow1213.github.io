Background:

Just some quick background on me: I graduated from Baylor with my B.S. in Computer Science in December 2011. My first job out of school was doing some technical consulting for the sales teams at Oracle. I realized two things at this job:

1. How passionate I was about technology, and coding
2. I am not a business/sales man in any way, shape or form

After six months at Oracle I took a job with Sogeti with the help and guidance of [Matt Hinze] (http://mhinze.com), who has been my personal/professional mentor throughout the duration of my development/consulting career. His guidance has been invaluable.

Since I started at Sogeti, I have been at Dell HQ in Round Rock helping out the teams working on dell.com. When Sogeti was in beginning contract talks with Dell, I knew both companies were taking a chance on me (the straight out of college developer with no real experience). So if there was ever a time I need to prove myself as a hard-working individual, it was now.

After being at this whole consulting thing for six months, I've been reflecting on what has made me (mildly) successful as an entry-level consultant. So I'd like to discuss what I perceive as the do's and don'ts of consulting.

Hopefully what I write over the next several posts isn't complete nonsense and can help another entry level developer in some way.
