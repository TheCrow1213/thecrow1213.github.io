I'm extremely excited to be giving a talk this weekend at [Austin Code Camp](http://codecamp13.adnug.org/ "Austin Code Camp 2013")!

There are some great talks scheduled throughout the day. Code camps are also just a great opportunity to learn, meet new people, and have fun (or at least I hope its fun for you if you're a dev).

Thanks ADNUG for putting this on, and I look forward to seeing everyone there!

## Abstract

Instantiation and coordination of dependencies is one our core responsibilities as software engineers. Managing these dependencies can become difficult in large systems, and can lead to inflexibility and hard to test code when not managed properly. Practicing Inversion of Control with the Dependency Injection pattern can help alleviate some of these pains.

There are also a number of tools available that offer advanced dependency injection capabilities. The usage of these tools can greatly increase the practice of Inversion of Control in your application, or destroy it. We will discuss the implications involved in using the new operator, how dependency injection can be used to enable Inversion of Control principles, and how advanced tooling can help and hurt your cause.
