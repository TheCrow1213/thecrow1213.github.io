    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm John, I'm a software developer for QuarterSpot. I work and play in Austin, the best city in Texas. I love my work, my friends, my coworkers, live music, and coffee shops. My goal in life is to be the pretentious Mac user at your favorite coffee shop who is seemingly writing something very important.</p>
