    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm John! I'm a software developer in <a href="http://bestdamncity.com/">Austin, the best city in Texas</a>. I love my work, my friends, live music, sci-fi,  and coffee shops. My goal in life is to be the pretentious Mac user at your favorite coffee shop who is seemingly writing something very important.</p>
